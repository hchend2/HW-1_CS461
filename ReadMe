the code consist of four deferent files, the mem.c where the code to 
manipulate memory is writen, the str.c file where the code to manipulate strings is 
writen, the memstrprint.h which the header file in which all the declaration are made, the printf.c file where the printf function in implemented, and the 
test.c file where the above write files are tested. it also has a Makefile which 
content rules on how to run the program and get output.


make: will compile the code and generate an executable file.
./a.test: run the executable show to output of the code if any
make test: compile all the code and run the executable right away and output 
result to sdtoutput.
make clean: remove all the abject files
make fclean remove all the object files and other binary files that may have 
been generated
